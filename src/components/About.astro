    <p>
      I'm an enthusiastic and dedicated <strong
        >Computer Engineering student at the University of Carlos III of Madrid</strong
      >, with a passion for staying at the forefront of technology since I was
      15, when I started to learn coding video games. Since then, I have been
      learning and improving my skills in different areas of software
      development, from <strong>web development to low-level programming</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      My passion for technology has led me to be a self-taught person, <strong
        >always looking for new challenges and learning new things through CTF's</strong
      >. This has allowed me to acquire a wide range of skills, from <strong
        >algorithmic thinking, problem solving and cybersecurity.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently <strong>expanding my skill set with Rust</strong>, a language
      that aligns with my commitment to performance and safety, and <strong
        >delving into the realm of Nix for robust and reproducible system
        configurations</strong
      >.
